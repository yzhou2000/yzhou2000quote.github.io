1. Knowledge is the beginning of practice; doing is the completion of knowing.
2. The sages do not consider that making no mistakes is a blessing. They believe, rather, that the great virture of man lies in his ability to correct his mistakes and continually make a new man of himself
3. To know and not to act is not know
4. People today distinguish between knowledge and action and pursue them separately, believing that one must know before he can act ..., They say[they will wait] till they truly know before putting their knowledge into practice. Consequently to the end of their lives, they will never act and also will never know.
5. Thought and learning are of small value unless translated into action
